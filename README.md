# Week 2: Visualization for Indian Agriculture Data Analysis  

## **Objective**  
The goal of this project is to analyze Indian agricultural data using Power BI. Week 2 focuses on more transformation of the dataset and preparing visualizations which could be used for creation of Dashboard. 

## **Steps Performed in Week 2**  
1. *Transformation of data*  
   - minor transformation such as capitalizing certain column values and changing data types were done.
   - performed grouping operation. 

2. *Column addition:*  
   - A custom column called yield_per_hectare was created which used the formula production/area in order to better visualize and analyse.
   - The error handling for the case with division by zero was done.   

3. *Created visualizations*  
   - Used Card charts for total distinct crop_names, area, total production.
   - Used Bar Charts for  production by crop_name, crop_name by season
   - Used Column Charts for sum of production by state_name, season
   - Used Slicers for year, state_name
   - Used Pie charts for crop contribution to production
   - Used Histogram for district_name vs area, production
   - Used Treemaps for average production by crop_year,average area by state_name, average production by state_name
   - Used Line chart for yearly production 
   - Used Map for yield_per_hectare by state_name
   - Used Scatter chart for Production vs. Area (Crop-Wise Analysis), Production vs. Area (State-Wise Analysis)

4. *Presentation*  
   - Arranged the charts and saved the powerbi file
